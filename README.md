# VennData

One of the biggest barriers to widespread machine learning adoption is the difficulty in collecting a 'good' dataset. There is an overall consensus that a 'good' dataset is a big dataset, but we believe that we can do better. As such the VennData project was created to develop tools to guide in the collection curation and augmentation of data.
