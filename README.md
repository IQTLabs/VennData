# VennData

One of the biggest barriers to widespread machine learning adoption is the difficulty in collecting a 'good' dataset. There is an overall consensus that a 'good' dataset is a big dataset, but we believe that we can do better. As such the VennData project was created to develop tools to guide in the collection curation and augmentation of data. 


# Research
Our research focuses on tackling a wide range of questions into the impacts of datasets on model performance such as, 
- Providing scores for data quality, and identifying mislabels.
- Identifying and correcting distribution shifts between test and train data.
- Understanding the role of augmentations such as pixel, perspective, rotation and translation on datasets.

# Environment and Software
### Structure
[Data_augmentation/](Data_augmentation/) - Techniques and tools used to augment data for improved performance.

[Data_Value/](Data_Value/) - tools for scoring the value of individual data in a dataset. 

[Utils/](Utils/) - Contains model definitions, training and evaluation scripts.
